====

Simulation model for prebiotic replicator (like RNAs) dynamics and evolution.

This simulation model is constructed mimicking translation-coupled RNA relpication system (TCRR system; Ichihashi _et al_., _Nat_. _Commun_., 2013).

## Simulations

This repository (PrebioDivSim) includes two simulations, `PrebioDivPreserv` and `PrebioDivEvo`.

`PrebioDivPreserv` is a simulation for determining whether compartmentalized replication systems are maintained or not.
Firstly a replicator network and its activity matrix are given, then the population dynamics is simulated fixed them.

`PrebioDivEvo` is a simulation for determining how compartmentalized replication systems evolved.

## Dependency

To use these simulations, `openmp` and `boost` must be installed in environment.

And, their operations are confirmed in `g++11` and `c++17 and later`.
